# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Project Statement

Code for Girls

This project covers only one repository

Our project prioritizes and reflects on DEI through a regular review of project policies and performance. This reflection is documented in the following DEI.md file based on specific [CHAOSS project](https://chaoss.community) DEI metrics.

### [Project Access](https://chaoss.community/?p=4953)

Project access is addressed in our project through various efforts. Through these efforts, we aim to support access for all. Specific efforts in our project include:

-  All virtual meetings are transcribed via the Zoom annotation tool, and members can join via their computer or phone. Video is not required to participate in virtual meetings.
-  Virtual meetings are attentive to global time zones. While most of our meetings occur during times that are most easily accessed by members in North America, South America, Western Europe, and Africa, virtual meetings are also held to support [Project Name] members in Asia-Pacific and Eastern Europe.
-  [Project Name] project maintainers and merge request coaches span global time zones and work asynchronously with contributors across the world.
-  Translation services are provided for all website pages.
- All areas of [Project Name] are considered open to community contributions. A stated goal of our project is that “everyone can contribute."
-  The [Project Name] SaaS product is conformant with the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT 2.4) revised in June 2023 as well as to level AA of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1.
-  Code for Girls is developing a unified contributor program that recognizes and rewards non-code contributors, including contributions through events, blog posts, and comments in issues and merge requests.

### [Communication Transparency](https://chaoss.community/?p=4957)

Communication Transparency is addressed in our project through a variety of different efforts. Through these efforts, we aim to support transparency for all. Specific efforts in our project include:

- All project documentation is publicly available via Google Docs and shared via our Code for Girls community handbook.
- Appropriate documentation is shared at the start of every working group meeting.
- Slack channels are regularly reviewed to determine if they should be public or private channels as well as considering if a channel is needed any longer.
- All virtual meetings are recorded and uploaded to our project YouTube channel.
- Decisions that impact the project are shared across numerous working groups meetings and associated Slack channels to ensure that as many project members can participate in the process.
- Any information that cannot be made public (e.g., security and abuse vulnerabilities, financial information, private data) is marked as internal to the project. All of the internal information is listed publicly by name and any other information not marked as internal are available externally to the public.
- Code for Girls operates using a single source of truth for all community members.
- Code for Girls's handbook is public and open to contribution.
- Code for Girls operates an unfiltered YouTube channel that shares all publicly available meetings, recordings, and community pairing sessions.


### [Newcomer Experiences](https://chaoss.community/?p=4891)

The newcomer experience is addressed in our project through a variety of different efforts. Through these efforts, we aim to support the newcomer experience for all new members. Specific efforts in our project include:

•	Newcomer events are held on a weekly basis in the Code for Girls. These events include newcomer orientation sessions and office hours open to all with an interest.
•	Code for Girls has a dedicated #newcomer channel on Slack where newcomers can join and learn about different ways to connect with the project. In the channel, we have a newcomer bot that provides detailed information on how to engage with the [Project Name]. The bot is available by typing ‘newbie’ in the #newcomer Slack channel.
•	A quick start guide for newcomers is posted on our website and made available through the main website navigation.
•	Code for Girls uses weekly triage reports on first time contributors who are awaiting a response to a merge request. This ensures newcomers always hear back from a real person about their merge request.
•	Code for Girls reviews contributor documentation for inclusivity of newcomers, including improvements to documentation navigation, technical content and jargon, and improving workflow processes for newcomers.
•	Code for Girls automatically applies a 1st contribution label to first-time contributors who open a merge request so they may be better identified and assisted by reviewers and coaches.
•	Code for Girls 's contributor documentation includes a full walkthrough tutorial for newcomers to make their first contribution. This includes setting up the development environment, making code changes, documentation updates and ways to find support.
•	Code for Girls has a dedicated Contributor Success team to facilitate newcomer onboarding, help newcomers find issues, assist newcomers through merge requests and communicate to reviewers on the behalf of contributors to ensure a smoother review experience.
•	Code for Girls offers a community fork which helps newcomers collaborate with other contributors under a shared fork. This means newcomers do not have to maintain and update a personal fork.
•	Code for Girls tracks metrics for new contributors with the goal of increasing total contributors to the project and helping convert new contributors into returning contributors.

### [Inclusive Leadership](https://chaoss.community/?p=3522)

Inclusive leadership is addressed in our project through a variety of different efforts. Through these efforts, we aim to support leadership opportunities for project members with an interest. Specific efforts in our project include:

•	Our Code for Girls governance document is reviewed and affirmed on a yearly basis to identify and articulate roles within the project that help guide the strategic direction of the project.
•	Global chapters of our project are led by people from those regions. Chapter leads help set the strategic direction of the Code for Girls as best suited in different global settings.
•	Working group meetings provide the opportunity to be led by different people at each meeting. While each working group has identified ‘chairs’, leading a meeting provides an opportunity to lead for all members.
•	Our projects ensures a diverse candidate slate and interview panel when selecting new maintainers.
•	All of our project maintainers have completed neurodiversity and other DEI training.
•	One or more of our project maintainers are a member of a working group related to a DEI initiative.
•	One or more of our project maintainers participate in DEI group meetings or events.
